      <h1>Minecraft</h1>
      I really like playing Minecraft.
      I got into Minecraft after watching a YouTuber named "Zebra Gamer"
      play it and downloaded it for myself on iPad originally in 2019, then I got it again
      on Nintendo Switch in 2020, then I got Java Edition on Windows 10 in 2021 and
      finally Minecraft for Windows 10/11 in 2022
     <h1>Coding</h1>
     I really like to code. I got into coding in 2020 using Code.org and made countless
     coding projects with coding blocks then I got in to JS, Python, CSS, and HTML.
     I will go to Code Ninjas in Clive, IA in summer of 2022
     <h1>Chatting</h1>
     I like chatting because it lets me talk and discuss things with my friends
     and family
